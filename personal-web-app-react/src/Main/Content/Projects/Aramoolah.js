            <p>This is a project that was made by myself by utilizing the free time that I have during the second semester of my third year in university.</p>
            <p>Since this is my first time doing anything with Android, I wanted to learn it through a familiar language, which is why I chose to write this application in Java. This does not mean that I will not learn Kotlin, as this is currently my next goal. During the development process, MVVM architectural design pattern was used as the basis on which the application was built.</p>
